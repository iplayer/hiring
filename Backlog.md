# Coding Exercise

Your team has been asked to create an Agile/Scrum task tracking system. This web system will allow the entire BBC to use this tool to manage their teamâ€™s backlog, and every employee will have access to it. 

You are part of the backend web service team, and are responsible for implementing a RESTful micro-service that represents the backlog. The REST service will have the following APIs:

## /backlog
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET  | List the stories in the backlog.                             |
| POST | Add a new story to the backlog. Use Story JSON format below. |

## /backlog/story/:id
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET  | Get a story with the unique identifier provided.             |
| PUT  | Update the story with the unique identifier provided.        |
|DELETE| Remove a story from the backlog.                             |



- Each Story class has 
  - `Id` which is a __unique__ identifier for each story,
  - `Points` which represents an estimate of development effort required to complete the story,
  - `Priority` which represents the business priority of the story. *Lower numeric value implies higher priority*, for example, a Story with Priority = 1 is more important than a Story with a Priority = 3. 
- The `getSprint(totalPointsAchievable)` method of the Backlog class should return a list of `Story` in the order of business priority, based on the number of points each story takes and the given `totalPointsAchievable` in a sprint.
- You are free to change the instance variable types if necessary.
- You may implement your solution in any appropriate (i.e. non-obscure) language, and you may choose to implement the storage of any relevant data structures in memory or using a database, but please make sure your solution is working end-to-end and you include instructions for us to run and test your code.
- You should consider how concurrent use of the system may impact your implementation.
- Your response will be evaluated against four key criteria:
  - Design, Modularisation and Componentisation
  - Testing Approach and Scenarios
  - Concurrency and Performance
  - Style and Readability
