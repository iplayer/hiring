# Coding Exercise

Your team has been asked to create an Agile/Scrum task tracking system. This web system will allow the entire BBC to use this tool to manage their teamâ€™s backlog, and every employee will have access to it. 

You are part of the backend web service team, and are responsible for implementing a RESTful micro-service that represents the backlog. The REST service will have the following APIs:

### /backlog

#### ``` GET /backlog ```
  * List the stories in the backlog in priority order. 
  * Returns 200 if a list of stories is retrieved.

#### ``` GET /backlog?points=:estimatedTotal ```
  * List all stories in the backlog (in priority order) that can be done given estimated total number of points that can be done. 
  * Returns 200 if a list of stories is retrieved. Returns 400 if estimatedTotal is negative, 0, or not a number.

#### ``` POST /backlog ```
  * Add a new story to the backlog. Use Story JSON format below. 
  * Returns 200 if the story is added. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.

#### ``` GET /backlog/story/:id ```
  * Get a story with the unique identifier provided. 
  * Returns 200 if the story is retrieved. If the story with that identifier does not exist, then returns 404.

#### ``` PUT /backlog/story/:id ```
  * Update the story with the unique identifier provided. Use Story JSON format below. 
  * Returns 200 if the story is updated. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.

#### ``` DELETE /backlog/story/:id ```
  * Remove a story from the backlog using the identifier provided. 
  * Returns 200 if the story is removed. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.

- What a Story looks like:
   ```javascript
   {
      "id": 123,      // unique identifier for each story.
      "points": 8,    // abstract unit of comeplexity. Typically the result of planning sessions involving playing cards.
      "priority": 1,  // business priority value. 1 is the highest, 5 is the lowest.
      "title": "Style the iPlayer icon to be more pink." 
   }
   ```
- You are free to change REST API signature if you think there's a nicer way to structure it.
- You may implement your solution in any appropriate (i.e. non-obscure) language, and you may choose to implement the storage of any relevant data structures in memory or using a database, but please make sure your solution is working end-to-end and you include instructions for us to run and test your code.
- You should consider how concurrent use of the system may impact your implementation.
- Your response will be evaluated against four key criteria:
  - Design, Modularisation and Componentisation
  - Testing Approach and Scenarios
  - Concurrency and Performance
  - Style and Readability
