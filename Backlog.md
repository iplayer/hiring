# Coding Exercise

Your team has been asked to create an Agile/Scrum task tracking system. This web system will allow the entire BBC to use this tool to manage their teamâ€™s backlog, and every employee will have access to it. 

You are part of the backend web service team, and are responsible for implementing a RESTful micro-service that represents the backlog. The REST service will have the following APIs:

### /backlog
* GET /backlog
  * List the stories in the backlog in priority order.
  * Returns 200 if a list of stories is retrieved.
* GET /backlog?points=:estimatedTotal
  * List all stories in the backlog (in priority order) that can be done given estimated total number of points that can be done.
  * Returns 200 if a list of stories is retrieved. Returns 400 if estimatedTotal is negative, 0, or not a number.
* POST /backlog
  * Add a new story to the backlog. 
  * Use Story JSON format below.
  * Returns 200 if the story is added. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.
* GET /backlog/story/:id
  * Get a story with the unique identifier provided.
  * Returns 200 if the story is retrieved. If the story with that identifier does not exist, then returns 404.
* PUT /backlog/story/:id
  * Update the story with the unique identifier provided. Use Story JSON format below. 
  * Returns 200 if the story is updated. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.
* DELETE /backlog/story/:id
  * Remove a story from the backlog using the identifier provided.
  * Returns 200 if the story is removed. Otherwise standard HTTP error code is returned.

```javascript
{
   "id": 123,
   "points": 8,
   "priority": 1,
   "title": "Style the iPlayer icon to be more pink."
}
```

- Each Story class has 
  - `Id` which is a __unique__ identifier for each story,
  - `Points` which represents an estimate of development effort required to complete the story,
  - `Priority` which represents the business priority of the story. *Lower numeric value implies higher priority*, for example, a Story with Priority = 1 is more important than a Story with a Priority = 3. 
- The `getSprint(totalPointsAchievable)` method of the Backlog class should return a list of `Story` in the order of business priority, based on the number of points each story takes and the given `totalPointsAchievable` in a sprint.
- You are free to change the instance variable types if necessary.
- You may implement your solution in any appropriate (i.e. non-obscure) language, and you may choose to implement the storage of any relevant data structures in memory or using a database, but please make sure your solution is working end-to-end and you include instructions for us to run and test your code.
- You should consider how concurrent use of the system may impact your implementation.
- Your response will be evaluated against four key criteria:
  - Design, Modularisation and Componentisation
  - Testing Approach and Scenarios
  - Concurrency and Performance
  - Style and Readability
